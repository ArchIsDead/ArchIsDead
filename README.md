Generate visualizations of GitHub user and repository statistics with GitHub
Actions. Visualizations can include data for both private repositories, and for
repositories you have contributed to, but do not own.

Generated images automatically switch between GitHub light theme and GitHub
dark theme.

## Background

When someone views a profile on GitHub, it is often because they are curious
about a user's open source projects and contributions. Unfortunately, that
user's stars, forks, and pinned repositories do not necessarily reflect the
contributions they make to private repositories. The data likewise does not
present a complete picture of the user's total contributions beyond the current
year.
